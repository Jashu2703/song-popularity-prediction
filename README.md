# 🎶 Song Popularity Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a song will be popular based on various audio features.

## 📌 Project Overview

**Song Popularity Prediction** is a machine learning project that analyzes features of songs (like danceability, energy, acousticness, etc.) to classify them as popular or not. The goal is to help understand what makes a song likely to trend based on its characteristics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze audio features to determine song popularity.
- Use classification techniques to build predictive models.
- Optimize accuracy using data preprocessing and feature engineering.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**

---

## 🔍 Features

- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Feature selection and correlation heatmaps
- Logistic Regression model (extendable to other classifiers)
- Evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report

---

## ✅ Outcome
